    "The \"classic\" NEB is a bit of a brute force approach. It takes a lot of trial and error to get below convergence criteria and it is costly. All of the \"images\" mentioned above are optimised per iteration, so if one is interested in getting to know the Minimum Energy Path (MEP) better, often number of DFT calculations goes into thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems associated with NEBs in general is that they rely heavily on the user-provided input structures. If they are not optimal due to complexity of the process, the MEP is elongated and the overall experiment becomes more expensive. There are ways of improving initial/final guesses, but not as straightforward with regular NEB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the complexity of the energy landscape we need to focus solely on the highest energy transition state and ignore the lesser maxima, which can arise due to rotations etc. For this we use a *climbing image* calculation (see NEB wiki for more info)."
