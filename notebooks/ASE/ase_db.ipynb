    "The ASE database feature offers a powerful way to explore and manage batches of calculations. It can be very convenient to parse a number of output files, scattered across a directory structure, to form a single file with all the useful data. \n",

    "**ASE supports three backends:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `SQLite3` is fully-featured relational database system which stores databases in local files. It's fast and widely-used for data serialisation in software. The file format is binary. You can inspect and modify ASE-generated SQLite3 files with regular sqlite3 tools, but some parameters (e.g. atomic positions) are stored as binary blobs.\n",
    "* `JSON` is a simple text-based format for data serialisation. This can be a good choice for long-term archiving and publication support. It will always be readable, but it's human-friendliness is overrated...\n",
    "* `PostgreSQL` is a more traditional server-hosted relational database system. This might be suitable for a group sharing data, but the configuration is correspondingly more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resources:**\n",
    "* For a more exhaustive overview see official ASE tutorial: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html#querying\n",
    "* Nice notebook with an overview of the topic, though it uses old python 2 syntax: https://github.com/WMD-group/ASE-Tutorials/blob/master/ase-db/ase-db.ipynb\n",
    "* ASE example of incorporating databases into the workflow: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html?highlight=database - sqlite3 library might not be readily available on all python versions on the supercomputers! (e.g. HAWK has that issue)\n",
