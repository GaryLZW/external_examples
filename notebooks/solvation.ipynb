    "FHI-Aims supports two of these schemes. The first being the Size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann implicit approach (SMPBE), which is derived from the self-consistent continuum solvation scheme (SCCS) proposed by Andreussi et al. [1,2]. The SMPBE scheme is practically to the SCCS but includes a Stern-layer correction to account for the inclusion of counter-ions. The second scheme is the multipole moment expansion (MPE) model. [3] This is computationally cheaper than the SCCS scheme, but does not support forces, so geometry optimisations cannot be run. "

Here, MPE uses a density isovalue ($Q_{\\text{iso}}$) whilst SMPBE uses density thresholds ($\\rho^{min}$ and $\\rho^{max}$). The density thresholds in SMPBE represent the sections of the electron density isosurface where the dielectric permittivity switches from 1 to $\\epsilon_{\\text{solvent}}$, as a smoothed continuous function.\n",

Note that '1' represents the Andreussi and Marzari dielectric function used in the SCCS formulism. The final argument (\"ions_conc\") defines the concentration of the ions in the electrolyte. It is essential that this is set to zero if counter-ions are not present, so that it reverts back to the SCCS formulism.

    "The original Andreussi and Sinstein et al. papers propose parametrisation constants for PBE and a small scope of other functionals, benchmarked against large testsets of free solvation energies. [2,3] However, it is often desirable to use other functionals, to properly describe the electronic properties of a given molecule. Sinstein et al. highlight that the functional and basis set chosen play a significant role in the solvation parameters. [3] Therefore, it is of use to be able to parametrize a solvation model for a given functional and basis set. To do this we run a number of implicit solvation calculations whilst varying the values of $\\rho^{min}$ and $\\rho^{max}$. Here, given the lesser effect of non-electrostatic interactions, only the density thresholds will be parametrised."
